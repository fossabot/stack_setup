# stack_setup
This is intended to allow users to almost effortlessly setup
the extensive toolchain involved in a functioning
Rust/Flutter/Python3 developement stack

The three language toolchains are not intended to be
intercompatible yet, as I am at a point in my skill level
where just doing a simple install script is quite taxing

Days forward, however, might see them used in a manner more interconnected
Maybe a Rust VM that runs dart and python, or birthing Safe Dart and Space Dart on that VM
as well as a Rusted flutter engine that can display and receive input in any Open/WebGL surface
